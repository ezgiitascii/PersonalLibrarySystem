# PersonalLibrarySystem
The LibMan project plans to build a personal library. The user whose main purpose is to login after registering to the system can add, edit and delete books. It saves a lot of information to the system, such as covers of books, title and author. The user can update the list by uploading JSON file to the system at any time or export the book list in the system in JSON format.
Users can update their personal information such as photos, names, username. Each user registered in the system can only operate on their own book list, other users cannot access this information.
